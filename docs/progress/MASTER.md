# Dual-Mode Extension AI Image Workflow: Master Progress

## Task

Build one SS ERP browser-extension image workbench with two explicit execution modes:

- `ERP_HOSTED`: ERP owns Provider execution, pricing, quota, queue, storage, candidate
  review, draft application, and Ozon publishing.
- `BYOK`: the extension background calls the user's approved AI Provider with a session-only
  API key, the user reviews results locally, ERP normalizes and binds accepted media, and the
  existing ERP publisher performs the final Ozon submission.

The workbench recreates the useful reference workflow in original SS ERP code and visual
language. It does not copy reference source, assets, branding, strings, identifiers, unsafe
credential storage, or direct Ozon calls.

## Implementation Phases

- [x] Phase 0: Contract and regression baseline (3/3 tasks) [details](./phase-0-contract-baseline.md)
- [x] Phase 1: Default-off security foundation (7/7 tasks) [details](./phase-1-security-foundation.md)
- [x] Phase 2: Secure single-image BYOK vertical slice (10/10 tasks) [details](./phase-2-byok-vertical-slice.md)
- [ ] Phase 3: Edit operations and batch engine (4/5 tasks) [details](./phase-3-edits-batch-engine.md)
- [x] Phase 4: Complete dual-mode workbench (5/5 tasks) [details](./phase-4-dual-mode-workbench.md)
- [ ] Phase 5: Publishing closure and product quality (3/4 tasks) [details](./phase-5-publish-quality.md)
- [ ] Phase 6: Pilot and release (0/3 tasks) [details](./phase-6-pilot-release.md)

Overall: 32/37 tasks complete (86%).

## Current Status

`DOC-01` is complete. The indexed extension AI image workbench guide now gives administrators and
users one accurate source for `ERP_HOSTED` versus `BYOK`, default-off feature flags, strict pilot
policy JSON, session-only Keys, persistent non-secret profile data, exact-origin permissions,
operation-specific capability evidence, external/ERP billing, Provider data disclosure,
`UNKNOWN_OUTCOME` recovery, ERP ingest/draft binding, and one-receipt Ozon publishing. Stale
development/deployment descriptions were corrected, and a documentation contract now protects the
required boundaries in preflight. Focused tests and full preflight passed. No implementation task is
dependency-ready until the exact paid `QA-02` Provider sandbox is explicitly approved and recorded;
`QA-04` and release remain downstream of that evidence. All flags remain default-off; no real
Provider request, charge, ERP ingest, Ozon write, production mutation, VPS access, or deployment
occurred.

## Next Steps

1. Do not start a paid `QA-02` probe until an edit-capable endpoint/model, exact credential
   revision, deployed commit, maximum cost, billing evidence path, and explicit approval are
   recorded. Do not repeat the two previously rejected `IMAGE_TO_IMAGE` requests.
2. After a single approved `QA-02` request, reconcile the settled Provider bill and record exact
   endpoint/model/operation/request-mode evidence before promoting any capability.
3. Run `QA-04` only after the exact paid `QA-02` evidence exists; then proceed to the owner/shop/
   device pilot and release gates.
4. Do not downgrade to an old extension while a BYOK batch is pending. Drain the batch first or use
   a rollback package carrying the new launch-session and Registry recovery layer.

## Cross-Conversation Protocol

At the start of every development session:

1. Read this file first.
2. Read the active phase file and its referenced plan section.
3. Check the current Git worktree without reverting unrelated user changes.
4. Mark exactly one active task in the native task tracker.
5. After completing a task, update its checkbox, the phase count, the overall count, Current
   Status, and Next Steps before moving to another task.

## Non-Negotiable Invariants

- API keys stay background-only in `chrome.storage.session` for the first release.
- BYOK creates no ERP AI generation reservation or settlement.
- Hosted paid execution always uses ERP cost controls and candidate review.
- Every publish-selected BYOK image is normalized, persisted, hashed, and draft-bound first.
- Both modes publish only through the existing ERP command-grant, receipt, and reconciliation
  path. The extension never stores Ozon credentials or calls Ozon directly.
- Provider capability evidence is exact to endpoint, model, operation, and request mode.
- No reference extension source, assets, branding, strings, identifiers, or unsafe defaults
  are copied.
